PeerJS to handle frontend connectinos between clients

Node.JS runtime environment with Express framework for central server

HTTP requests (with query paramters) in order to access stuff on the central server
such as room and word/description information

Might be faster to give the server an HTTP request with a seed as a query paramter and
have the server generate the puzzle as a 2D array with an array of descriptions sent back
to the host clients

Peer to peer is ALL frontend when they enter a game and no longer require server/database information

Backend is the central server/database used for conencting peers and getting database information
